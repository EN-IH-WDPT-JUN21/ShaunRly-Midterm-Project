Should CreditCard have a minimumBalance?

How to test for time sensitive requirments like fraud protection?

Do I need to make Converters for all non-entity custom class properties in tables?
- Have we done this in class?
- Why does the error happen with classes of only primitive types

Is there a better way to instantiate an object from an array/list as done in Address Converter?

Needed to add "spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.enable_lazy_load_no_trans=true" to application properties
but I don't know why or from where the error is coming from since it comes from unknown sauce in log

Can a property annotated with @Convert be left null

BigDecimal currBalance = savingsRepository.getById(savings1.getId()).getBalance().getAmount();
assertEquals(BigDecimal.valueOf(1000.00), currBalance);
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError:
Expected :1000.0 ???
Actual   :1000.00 ???

Is there anyway to do the commented out call in PaymentOut() test?
